The message reads: \"3 + 4 * 2 = ?\" However, there's a twist: each symbol functions differently depending on its position in the sequence. The first symbol represents addition (+), the second symbol represents subtraction (-), the third symbol represents multiplication (*), and the fourth symbol represents division (/). What is the result of the equation according to this rule?"
